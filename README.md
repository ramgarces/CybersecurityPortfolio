# Cybersecurity Portfolio

As a dedicated IT professional with a passion for cybersecurity, I am eager to transition into the role of a Cybersecurity Analyst. The world of cybersecurity, with its evolving concepts and tools, captivates me, driving my daily commitment to acquiring new skills. My goal is to contribute effectively to any organization by implementing and upholding robust security standards. Strong communication skills complement my technical expertise, ensuring a seamless integration of cybersecurity measures in the ever-changing landscape of technology.

### _Conducting an Internal Security Audit_
For this first Portfolio Activity from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification course, I conducted an internal security audit for a ficitonal company. The activity provides you with supplemental materials that outline the different control categories to look for in one file, and another file that provides the details about the fictional company called Botium Toys. The file with details about Botium Toys goes into detail about what controls the company has in place, what controls the company may be lacking on, and some assets that the company keeps track of. The task to be performed in this activity is to use the provided Controls and Compliance Checklist file to identify what controls are in place, what controls are not in place, and whether or not the company is in-line with some common industry compliances and standards, indicated by checking a "yes" or "no" box. 

After checking the necessary boxes from referencing the supplimental material, there is an optional section where suggestions can be made about what controls or methods can be put into place to fix the issues that were found. I provided some of my own recommendations at the bottom of the page as you can see from in link to the file below.

[Here](https://github.com/ramgarces/CybersecurityPortfolio/blob/main/Controls%20and%20Compliance%20Checklist%20-%20Ramiro%20Garces%20Jr.pdf) is the copy of my Controls and Compliance Checklist from the activity.
